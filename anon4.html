<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">All about Guinea Pigs</h1>
<p style="color:DarkBlue;"><hr>It all started when me and my brothers really wanted a pet. We wanted a cat but because of our current predicament (and also our cat allergies), we were unable to do so. We went to the pet store over the weekend in hopes of getting a hamster but instead we came home with a guinea pig. My weeks of research on hamsters went to waste which was pretty upsetting but I had to quickly begin researching on guinea pigs so that we could properly care for them. I've decided that this is the perfect place to compile everything so that it would be helpful for someone who knows nothing about them and would like to get one of their own.</p>
<h2 style="background-color:SkyBlue;">Things you must know before purchasing a Guinea Pig:</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b><Font Size=4>1. Never buy a guinea pig alone</Font></b></dt>
<dd style="color:SlateBlue;"> - Guinea pigs are herd animals so they don't like being alone. If you bring home only one, chances are they would become depressed and really lonely.</dd>
<dt><b><Font Size=4>2. Pet store cages are too small.</Font></b></dt>
<dd style="color:SlateBlue;"> - If you were like me and knew nothing about guinea pigs when first purchasing them, then you probably bought everything that the employee said was necessary to buy. The truth is that pet store cages are way too small. Guinea pigs need there cage to be atleast 8 square feet. They should be able to run freely in their cage without feeling constricted. We made ours out of cardboard since we had a lot of it lying around. There are many tutorials on how to make proper cages. Check this one out:<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f04DTmuJDuE> How to build a guinea pig cage</a>
<dt><b><Font Size=4>3. They are very high maintenance.</Font></b></dt>
<dd style="color:SlateBlue;"> - If you are looking for a pet that is really simple and easy to take care of then this animal probably isn't for you. You need to constantly clean there cage since they can get pretty messy. You have to be willing to take the responsibility and take care of them.</dd>
<h3><hr> Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li> It may take some time for a guinea pig to get used to their owner and their new surroundings. Don't force them out and give them some time and eventually they won't hesitate to be around you.
<li> Guinea pigs wheek when they hear their owners come by. They probaby know that you are there to give them a treat. This is what it sounds like:
