Hello, I am a student that will be starting college this fall. I plan on double majoring in Engineering and Visual Fine Arts, but let's see how that goes. I can be ambitious and sometimes that is the death of me. The two thing I know how to do for sure are visual arts and fine arts or in other words drawing, painting, and dance. I am a very socially awkward person, but I am working on my confidence. In my free time I like to cook, workout, and play the guitar (and learn new skills if I am in the mood - some include beatboxing, and skateboarding). I am a very average student that easily blends into the crowd and tries the best at everything I do. I don't have a story, but soon I hope to create one and leave behind a pretty awesome legacy that at least my kids would admire.<P>

At 18 years old I have not accomplished as much as many other students my age but I plan to change that soon. The recent on-going pandemic allowed me to realize how much I have missed out in the world. I have started adding to my bucket list but also slowly checking things off. During times like these there needs to be a balance between maximizing the newly found time wisely and finally getting to relax and have fun.Now, I was never the person to reach for the starts because I still don't know what I want out of my life, but I intend to keep searching until I am satisfied. This may be hard since I am not the most social person out there and the I blame on the number of times I moved, depriving me of having friends that last longer that 3 years or so. Well, enough of this lets go make a story out of my life shall we?<P>
