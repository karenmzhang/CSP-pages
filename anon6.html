		<h1>Bibilly Bob</h1>
		<b>Bibilly Bob</b> is a young boy who is two years old. His favorite food is pizza and his favorite drink is water. However, he recognizes that air is a fluid too, and to not be discriminatory he consumes air twice a day, after it has been dissolved in some water <font color="green">of course.</font> <p>

		He also enjoys doing other things, like walking. He walks up the stairs and then back down again. He does several sets of this before sitting on the ground to inhale the fresh air around him. Another thing he enjoys is biting things. He bites on his tiny rubber ball for a large portion of the day, except when he is walking or eating <font color="green">of course.</font> <p> 

		After a long day of walking and biting, as well as some talking, the boy goes to sleep at 8:30 AM. After that, he makes sure to sleep until 8:30 PM, to get a perfect 12 hours of sleep. The curious reader may be wondering why he sleeps during dailight hours, and the reason is so that he can see the sunrise. Every morning, he falls asleep watching the sunrise, biting on his tiny ball. Luckily for him, his parents also follow this schedule, as well as the rest of the people in his world. This concludes the report to Bibilly's doctor.
