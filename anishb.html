    <ul><H1><b><u><center><mark>Omce upom a timme:</mark></center></H1></b></u> <li><H2><p><mark>there was a very funny looking dog named 
    <font color="red" size=6><b>cheems</font></b>. His 
    name was birthed from a comedic misspelling <br>of the word "cheeseburger" as "cheemsburbger." This 
    is very quirky. Someone happened to pair this <br>word with this funny looking image of this dog, 
    and the meme was born. Whenever cheems <br>spoke in memes, he would speak with a "speemch
    impemdimemt," that made him stutter with <br>m sounds in his speech constantly. At first, 
    I hated this joke. I thought it was really <br>stupid, just a random = funny meme 
    that you would see in 2012. However, that <br>all changed one day...</mark>

    <li><p><mark>Here are two examples of <font color="red" size=6><b>cheems</font></b> memes: <A HREF="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/261913945688768513/720106635049304064/unknown.png">image one</A>

    <li><p><mark>After expressing my disdain over this stupid joke constantly to my friends, one of my
    <br>friends, Alex, decided that it would be funny to bet another one of my friends, James,
    <br>$5 to make me like <font color="red" size=6><b>cheems</font></b>. After James let me know of this, I hatched a nefarious plan.
    <br>I would pretend as if he had shown me that <font color="red" size=6><b>cheems</font></b> is actually funny, and laugh whenever
    <br>a meme of him was shown to me. Then, James would split the $5 with me, 50/50, a net gain
    <br>of $2.50. It was perfect!</mark>

    <li><p><mark>However, no one could have predicted what would come next. The memes. They got stupider.
    <br>More ironic, more meta, more wacky and silly. Alex wouldn't budge. He suspected that I
    <br>may actually still dislike <font color="red" size=6><b>cheems</font></b>. As I kept laughing, and laughing, and laughing, at
    <br>these horrible, lazy jokes, something changed from within me. I broke. It was like a
    <br>stockholm effect triggered by a silly image of a funny dog. I couldn't stop laughing.</mark>

    <li><p><mark>To this day, my brain is still broken. I still laugh, whenever I see an image of this
    <br>dog, no matter how lazy or unfunny it is. And the worst part: Alex never kept his word
    <br>and paid up, despite the fact that James telling me about the bet that day literally
    <br>lead to me liking <font color="red" size=6><b>cheems</font></b> memes.</mark>
