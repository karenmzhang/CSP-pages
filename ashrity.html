        <FONT COLOR='yellow'>There was once a boy named  Tani, but the truth is he died in a war with the Muslims after<br>
            his wife died, so it is now his story.  It was a battle in which he killed his wife. <br>
            His wife, I am not saying that we had the courage to kill his son. <br>
            It was like we had a gun. It was not like a gun. <br>
            After <i>this massacre</i> of Hindus and Christians there was the story. <br>
            The one thing that made me think about it was that my <U>children</U> were victims <br>
        of those who were wrongfully slaughtered.</FONT>
